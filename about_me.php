            <p>I’m Destina. I’m a camera geek.</p>

            <p>Originally from Plymouth, I moved to Wales in 2012 to study Film &amp; TV at Aberystwyth University. I graduated
            with a First-Class Honours in 2015 and I was awarded the RTS Student Television Awards (Wales) for my final
            university film. After six wonderful years in the heart of mid-wales, I came back to my hometown to be closer to family.</p>

            <p>Since uni, I have worked as a runner for the BBC and ITV, produced promotional videos for local businesses and worked as an editor on various adventure documentaries, such as Hannah Engelkamp’s <i>Seaside Donkey</i>, Leon McCarron’s <i>The Land Beyond</i> and Rob Lilwall’s <i>Desert of Death</i>.</p>

            <p>In the summer of 2016, I decided to venture into the world of wedding videography. Why? Because weddings are
            beautiful, emotional and meaningful. It’s a massive privilege to be able to capture a couple’s special day
            on film - to create a visual memory that will be watched now and many years into the future.</p>

            <p>Whilst a perfectionist, I am relaxed and easygoing. I love to meet clients beforehand to get to know them
            and for them to get to know me. This also means I can be as self-sufficient as possible on the day, allowing
            me to take a fly-on-the-wall approach to capture natural, authentic shots. You’ll hardly notice me.</p>

            <p>No two weddings are the same and through unobtrusive filming techniques and a rich and cinematic editing
            style, I am able to create a bespoke wedding video that tells your story.</p>

            <p>Enough about me. Let’s hear about you! <a href="contact.php">Get in touch</a>.</p>
