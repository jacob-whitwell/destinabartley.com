        <p class="text-title">Why should we have a wedding video?</p>
        <p class="answer">Through video you will be able to relive your wedding day with family and friends, now and many years into the future. There are so many special moments that photography alone can’t always capture. Whereas still photos convey a single moment, a wedding video records the hidden detail and raw emotion of the day - the nerves, the excitement, the joy. Video is a permanent visual memory and it’s priceless.</p>


        <p class="text-title">Will you be in the way?</p>
        <p class="answer">I aim to take a “fly on the wall” approach in order to capture authentic moments without being obvious. I use very small cameras as well as zoom lenses for times such as the ceremony and speeches. I understand that it’s your big day and I try my best to blend into the background and be as self-sufficient as possible. I highly recommend a meet up prior to the wedding so that I can gather all needed information beforehand.</p>


        <p class="text-title">Can we choose the music for our wedding video?</p>
        <p class="answer">I am more than happy to take suggestions, however I cannot guarantee that it will be used. This is due to legality and copyright issues – all music needs to be licensed and for popular songs this will be very expensive. Music is also an integral part of the story-telling process and in order to tell your story effectively, I need to have full creative control. Rest assured though, I strive to find beautiful, effective, licensed music for each video.</p>

        <p class="text-title">How long until we receive our video?</p>
        <p class="answer">Most companies require up to 12 weeks to complete the edit. I feel that this is far too long to make you, your friends and family wait to relive your special day. I therefore endeavour to provide your finished video within 4-6 weeks.</p>
